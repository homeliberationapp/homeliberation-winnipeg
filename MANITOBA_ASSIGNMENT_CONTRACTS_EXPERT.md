**For Subject-To Deals (Assuming Existing Mortgage):**
Add these clauses:

```
CLAUSE AB: SUBJECT-TO EXISTING FINANCING

Buyer is acquiring Property "subject to" existing mortgage(s):

Mortgage Holder: [Bank Name]

Seller agrees to:
(a) Transfer possession to Buyer on Closing
(b) NOT pay off existing mortgage
(c) Buyer to make all future mortgage payments
(d) Seller to authorize Buyer to contact lender directly
(e) Seller to provide mortgage statements and payment history

Seller acknowledges:
→ Title transfers to Buyer (or Buyer's Assignee)
→ Mortgage remains in Seller's name
→ Seller remains liable to lender (unless lender releases)
→ Buyer will make payments but has no personal liability to lender

This is NOT an assumption of mortgage (no lender approval required).

Legal Authority: Real Property Act, C.C.S.M. c. R30 - "Subject-to"
purchases are legal (buyer takes title subject to existing lien).

Note: Mortgage may contain "due on sale" clause. Seller acknowledges
risk that lender may accelerate loan. Buyer not liable if lender
accelerates.
