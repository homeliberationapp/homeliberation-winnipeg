## 📊 INCOME PROPERTY VALUATION (THE CORRECT WAY)

### **STEP 1: Calculate Net Operating Income (NOI)**

**Formula (Used by ALL Commercial Investors):**

```
GROSS SCHEDULED INCOME (GSI)
= Total Units × Average Rent × 12 Months

Example (12-unit building):
12 units × $1,000/month × 12 = $144,000 GSI

────────────────────────────────────────

VACANCY LOSS
= GSI × Vacancy Rate

Winnipeg Multi-Family Vacancy Rates (2025):
- Class A (new, premium): 3-4%
- Class B (good condition): 4-6%
- Class C (older, value-add): 6-10%

Example (Class B, 5% vacancy):
$144,000 × 0.05 = $7,200 vacancy loss

────────────────────────────────────────

EFFECTIVE GROSS INCOME (EGI)
= GSI - Vacancy Loss

Example:
$144,000 - $7,200 = $136,800 EGI

────────────────────────────────────────

OPERATING EXPENSES
= Property Taxes + Insurance + Utilities +
  Maintenance + Repairs + Property Management +
  Legal/Accounting + Marketing + Reserves

Winnipeg Multi-Family Operating Expense Ratios:
- Class A (newer, low maintenance): 35-40% of EGI
- Class B (average): 40-50% of EGI
- Class C (older, higher maintenance): 50-60% of EGI

Example (Class B, 45% expenses):
$136,800 × 0.45 = $61,560 expenses

────────────────────────────────────────

NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI)
= EGI - Operating Expenses

Example:
$136,800 - $61,560 = $75,240 NOI

════════════════════════════════════════
ANNUAL NOI: $75,240
════════════════════════════════════════
```

### **STEP 2: Apply Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)**

**Formula:**

```
PROPERTY VALUE = NOI ÷ Cap Rate

Cap Rate = Rate of Return Expected by Investors
```

**Winnipeg Multi-Family Cap Rates (January 2025):**

**By Property Class:**
- **Class A** (Built 2010+, premium finishes, professional mgmt):
  - Cap Rate: 4.0-5.0%
  - Example Areas: South Winnipeg, Tuxedo, River Heights

- **Class B** (Built 1980-2010, good condition, stable):
  - Cap Rate: 5.0-6.5%
  - Example Areas: St. Vital, Fort Garry, St. James

- **Class C** (Built 1950-1980, older, value-add opportunity):
  - Cap Rate: 6.5-8.5%
  - Example Areas: North End, West End, Transcona

- **Class D** (Built pre-1950, significant deferred maintenance):
  - Cap Rate: 8.5-11.0%
  - Example Areas: Core area, requires major renovation

**By Unit Count:**
- 3-4 units (small multi): 7-9% (less liquid, harder to sell)
- 5-12 units (mid-size): 6-8%
- 13-24 units (commercial): 5.5-7.5%
- 25-50 units (small apartment): 5-7%
- 50+ units (large apartment): 4.5-6.5%

**Calculate Property Value:**

```
Example (Class B, 12-unit, 6.0% cap rate):

Property Value = $75,240 NOI ÷ 0.06
Property Value = $1,254,000

AS-IS MARKET VALUE: $1,254,000
```

---

## 🏢 EXAMPLE 1: 8-UNIT EQUITY ASSIGNMENT (CLASS B)

**Property Details:**
- 8 units (older walk-up, 1960s building)
- Location: St. Vital, Winnipeg
- Average rent: $950/unit (below market, currently $1,100)
- Condition: Cosmetic updates needed
- Owner: Tired landlord, owned 22 years

**STEP 1: Calculate Current NOI (As-Is Condition)**

```
Gross Scheduled Income:
8 units × $950/month × 12 = $91,200

Vacancy Loss (7% for Class C mgmt):
$91,200 × 0.07 = $6,384

Effective Gross Income:
$91,200 - $6,384 = $84,816

Operating Expenses (50% - older building, poor mgmt):
Property taxes: $12,000/year
Insurance: $4,800/year
Utilities (common areas): $3,600/year
Maintenance/repairs: $8,500/year
Property management (10%): $9,120/year
Reserves: $4,000/year
Legal/accounting: $1,500/year
TOTAL EXPENSES: $43,520 (51% of EGI)

Net Operating Income (NOI):
$84,816 - $43,520 = $41,296 NOI
```

**STEP 2: Calculate As-Is Property Value**

```
Current Cap Rate: 7.5% (Class C property, poor management)

Property Value = $41,296 ÷ 0.075
AS-IS VALUE: $550,613

Round to: $550,000
```

**STEP 3: Your Equity Play**

```
Seller's Situation:
- Mortgage owed: $320,000
- Tired of tenants (22 years)
- Deferred maintenance ($35k needed)
- Wants to retire

EQUITY AVAILABLE:
$550,000 (value) - $320,000 (mortgage) = $230,000

Your Target Contract Price: 75% of As-Is Value
$550,000 × 0.75 = $412,500

INSTANT EQUITY IN YOUR CONTRACT:
$550,000 - $412,500 = $137,500
```

**STEP 4: Your Negotiation**

```
Seller wants: $480,000 (thinks it's worth more)

Your approach: Show seller the MATH
"Mr. Owner, here's what commercial investors see:

Current Income: $91,200/year
Current Expenses: $43,520/year
Net Income: $41,296/year

Investors buying at 7.5% cap rate:
$41,296 ÷ 0.075 = $550,613 maximum value

But you have deferred maintenance ($35k)
And rents are below market
And vacancy is high from poor management

Realistic investor price: $500,000-$525,000

I can offer $412,500 cash, close in 30 days.
That's $92,500 in your pocket after mortgage.
No showings. No financing contingency. Done."

Seller counter: $450,000
Your counter: $425,000
FINAL ACCEPTED: $425,000
```

**STEP 5: Your Assignment Strategy**

```
Your Contract Price: $425,000
Instant Equity: $550,000 - $425,000 = $125,000

Your Assignment Fee: $45,000 (36% of equity)

Buyer Pays:
$425,000 (to seller) + $45,000 (to you) = $470,000 total

Buyer's Analysis:
Purchase: $470,000
Immediate repairs: $35,000
Total Investment: $505,000

After Repairs (new NOI):
- Increase rents to market: $1,100/unit
- New GSI: 8 × $1,100 × 12 = $105,600
- Better management (5% vacancy): -$5,280
- EGI: $100,320
- Improved operations (45% expenses): -$45,144
- NEW NOI: $55,176

New Property Value at 6.5% cap (better class):
$55,176 ÷ 0.065 = $848,862

Buyer's Equity Position:
Value: $848,862
Investment: -$505,000
BUYER'S EQUITY: $343,862 (40% instant equity!)

YOUR PROFIT: $45,000 assignment fee
```

**STEP 6: Finding Your Buyer**

Target buyers for 8-unit:
- Local syndicators
- Mom-and-pop investors upgrading from SFH
- 1031 exchange buyers
- Small REITs

Marketing:
"8-unit St. Vital apartment building
Current NOI: $41k, proforma NOI: $55k+
Under contract at $470k, worth $850k after value-add
40% equity position, 6.5% current cap
Email for proforma"

Time to assign: 5-10 days (multiple offers expected)

## 🏢 EXAMPLE 2: 24-UNIT APARTMENT BUILDING (INSTITUTIONAL PLAY)

**Property Details:**
- 24 units (1970s low-rise, 3 floors)
- Location: Fort Garry, Winnipeg
- Mix: 16 × 1BR ($1,000), 8 × 2BR ($1,250)
- Condition: Average, needs cosmetic updates
- Owner: Estate sale (owner passed, heirs liquidating)

**STEP 1: Calculate Current NOI**

```
Gross Scheduled Income:
(16 units × $1,000) + (8 units × $1,250) = $26,000/month
Annual GSI: $26,000 × 12 = $312,000

Vacancy Loss (6% - estate management is poor):
$312,000 × 0.06 = $18,720

Effective Gross Income:
$312,000 - $18,720 = $293,280

Operating Expenses (48% - mid-size building):
Property taxes: $42,000/year
Insurance: $12,000/year
Utilities: $18,000/year
Maintenance: $28,000/year
Property management (8%): $23,462/year
Reserves (24 units × $300): $7,200/year
Legal/accounting: $4,500/year
Marketing/vacancy: $6,000/year
TOTAL EXPENSES: $141,162 (48% of EGI)

Net Operating Income:
$293,280 - $141,162 = $152,118 NOI
```

**STEP 2: Calculate As-Is Value**

```
Current Cap Rate: 6.5% (Class B, 24 units)

Property Value = $152,118 ÷ 0.065
AS-IS VALUE: $2,340,277

Round to: $2,340,000
```

**STEP 3: Your Equity Play**

```
Seller Situation (Estate):
- Mortgage owed: $1,450,000
- Heirs live out of province
- No interest in managing
- Want quick liquidation
- Property has $45k deferred maintenance

EQUITY AVAILABLE:
$2,340,000 - $1,450,000 = $890,000

Your Target: 70-75% of As-Is Value
$2,340,000 × 0.72 = $1,684,800

INSTANT EQUITY:
$2,340,000 - $1,684,800 = $655,200
```

**STEP 4: Your Negotiation (Estate Sale Strategy)**

```
Estate executor wants: $2,100,000 (thinks it's worth $2.5M)

Your approach (with heirs):
"I understand the family wants maximum value. Let me show you
what institutional buyers will pay:

Current NOI: $152,118
Institutional cap rates for 24-unit Class B: 6.5-7.0%

High valuation: $152,118 ÷ 0.065 = $2,340,277
Low valuation: $152,118 ÷ 0.070 = $2,173,114

But there are issues:
- Deferred maintenance: $45,000
- Below-market rents (can't raise until repairs done)
- Management transition costs: $15,000
- Vacancy during transition: $20,000

Real buyer price range: $2,100,000-$2,200,000

Timeline if you list publicly:
- 60-90 days to find buyer
- 30-60 days due diligence
- 45 days to close
TOTAL: 4-6 months

Your carrying costs (mortgage, taxes, insurance):
$11,000/month × 5 months = $55,000

Problems during listing:
- Tenants hear building for sale = move-outs
- Buyers disturbing tenants with inspections
- Deferred maintenance gets worse
- Winter delays everything

I can offer $1,720,000:
- Close in 45 days (or sooner)
- No tenant disruption
- I handle all deferred maintenance
- Clean transaction
- Family gets $270,000 after mortgage + closing

After carrying costs, you'd net same amount in 6 months
AND avoid all the headaches."

Heirs counter: $1,850,000
Your counter: $1,750,000
FINAL ACCEPTED: $1,775,000
```

**STEP 5: Your Assignment Strategy**

```
Your Contract Price: $1,775,000
Instant Equity: $2,340,000 - $1,775,000 = $565,000

Your Assignment Fee: $125,000 (22% of equity)
(Lower % because larger deal, easier to assign)

Buyer Pays:
$1,775,000 (to estate) + $125,000 (to you) = $1,900,000 total

Buyer's Analysis:
Purchase: $1,900,000
Immediate repairs/capex: $80,000
Total Investment: $1,980,000

After Value-Add (new NOI):
- Renovate units: $80,000
- Increase rents: 1BR to $1,150, 2BR to $1,400
- New GSI: $327,600/year
- Better management (4% vacancy): -$13,104
- EGI: $314,496
- Improved operations (42% expenses): -$132,088
- NEW NOI: $182,408

New Property Value at 6.0% cap (improved class):
$182,408 ÷ 0.06 = $3,040,133

Buyer's Equity Position:
Value: $3,040,133
Investment: -$1,980,000
BUYER'S EQUITY: $1,060,133 (35% instant equity!)

Plus cash flow:
NOI: $182,408
Debt service (70% LTV @ 5.5%): -$93,000/year
CASH FLOW: $89,408/year (4.5% cash-on-cash return)

YOUR PROFIT: $125,000 assignment fee
```

**STEP 6: Finding Your Buyer (Institutional Level)**

Target buyers for 24-unit:
- Small/mid-size REITs
- Private equity funds
- Apartment syndicators
- 1031 exchange (large)
- Family offices

Marketing approach:
"24-unit Fort Garry apartment building
$152k current NOI, $182k+ proforma
Under contract $1.9M all-in
Worth $3M+ after light value-add
35% equity, 6.0% going-in cap, 4.5% CoC
Full ARGUS model available
Confidential - NDA required"

Time to assign: 7-14 days
(Institutional buyers move fast on good deals)

## 🎯 OFF-MARKET APARTMENT TARGETING SYSTEM

### **WHY OWNERS SELL OFF-MARKET:**

1. **Don't want tenants to know** (causes panic, move-outs)
2. **Privacy** (wealthy owners, family offices)
3. **Avoid market stigma** (if building has issues)
4. **Speed** (need quick liquidity)
5. **Avoid broker fees** (6% on $2M = $120k saved)
6. **Testing market** (see what offers come in)
7. **1031 exchange timing** (need to close in 45 days)

### **FINDING OFF-MARKET DEALS:**

**Method 1: Property Tax Records (Public Data)**

Access Winnipeg Assessment & Taxation:
- https://www.winnipegassessment.com/
- Search by address, owner name, or assessment roll

Target criteria:
- Multi-family (3+ units)
- Owner for 10+ years (likely older, tired)
- Out-of-province owner address (absentee)
- High assessed value increase (property appreciated, time to cash out)
- Corporate ownership ending in "Ltd" or "Inc" (may be selling)

Pull data:
- Owner name
- Mailing address
- Property details
- Assessment value
- Tax status

Create direct mail list:
500-1,000 owners meeting criteria

**Method 2: Corporate Registry Search**

Manitoba Companies Office:
- Search for numbered companies (123456 Manitoba Ltd)
- Many apartments owned through corps
- Registry shows directors/officers (actual owners)
- Some corps formed 20-40 years ago = aging owners

Target:
- Old corporations (formed 1970s-1990s)
- Directors age 65+ (ready to retire)
- Single-director corps (no succession plan)

**Method 3: Probate/Estate Sales**

Court of King's Bench - Probate Division:
- Public record of deceased persons' estates
- Often includes real estate

Process:
- Check weekly probate filings
- Identify multi-family properties in estates
- Contact estate lawyer or executor directly
- Heirs usually want quick sale

Your advantage:
- Heirs don't know value
- Want to split proceeds quickly
- Don't want management hassle
- Below-market pricing common

**Method 4: Property Manager Referrals**

Target property management companies:
- They know which owners are burnt out
- They know which properties are for sale (before listed)
- They want easy transition

Your offer to PMs:
"I buy multi-family buildings in Winnipeg.
If you have a client looking to sell, I pay $2,000 referral fee.
Quick closes, no hassle, confidential."

PMs will call you FIRST before owner lists.

**Method 5: Divorce Attorney Network**

Divorce = forced asset sales

Build relationships with family lawyers:
- Attend legal networking events
- Offer $3,000 referral fee
- "I help divorcing couples liquidate real estate quickly"

Attorneys will refer you to:
- Couples splitting jointly-owned apartments
- Need quick sale to divide assets
- Below-market pricing to avoid fighting

**Method 6: "Tired Landlord" Direct Mail Campaign**

Letter to 10+ year owners:

```
[Owner Name]
[Address]

Dear [Name],

I'm a private buyer of multi-family properties in Winnipeg.

I noticed you've owned [Address] for [X] years.

If you've ever considered selling - or know you eventually will -
I'd like to have a brief, confidential conversation.

I specialize in:
→ Private transactions (no public listings)
→ No tenant disruption
→ Quick closes (30-45 days)
→ Buying "as-is" with deferred maintenance
→ Fair pricing based on actual income

I'm not a broker or agent. I'm a principal buyer who closes.

If you're open to a 15-minute call to discuss:

[Your Name]
[Phone]
[Email]

P.S. Even if you're not selling now, I'd be happy to provide a
free, no-obligation valuation so you know what your property
is worth.
```

Mail to 500 owners, expect:
- 2-3% response rate = 10-15 calls
- 20% of calls become deals = 2-3 assignments
- 2-3 deals × $50k avg fee = $100k-150k from one mailing

**Method 7: Door-Knocking Older Buildings**

Target buildings built 1950s-1970s:
- Original owners now 70-90 years old
- Likely considering sale
- May not know value

Process:
- Identify 20-30 older buildings in target area
- Visit on weekend morning
- Knock on superintendent's door OR
- Knock on unit doors, ask "Who owns building?"

Script:
"Hi, I'm [Name]. I buy apartment buildings in Winnipeg.
Do you know if the owner has ever considered selling?
I'm looking to make a confidential offer."

Success rate: 5-10% of buildings lead to owner conversation

**Method 8: LinkedIn/Facebook Owner Groups**

Join:
- Winnipeg Real Estate Investors group
- Manitoba Landlords Association
- Canadian Apartment Association (Manitoba chapter)

Post occasionally:
"Private buyer seeking multi-family (5+ units) in Winnipeg.
Off-market only. Quick close. DM me."

Network at events:
- Monthly REI meetups
- Landlord association meetings
- Property management conferences

**Method 9: "Expired Listing" Follow-Up**

Monitor MLS for:
- Multi-family listings that expire (didn't sell)
- Listed 90+ days

Contact owner directly:
"I noticed your building at [Address] didn't sell.
Often this happens when it's overpriced or buyers can't get financing.
I'm a cash buyer. Can we talk?"

Owner is now MORE motivated:
- Already wanted to sell
- Public listing failed
- Carrying costs continuing
- May accept lower price

**Method 10: Building Code Violation Search**

City of Winnipeg Building Inspections:
- Public record of code violations, work orders
- Owners with violations often want to sell

Target:
- Buildings with outstanding work orders
- Owners who haven't fixed issues (burnt out)

Your pitch:
"I see your building has an outstanding work order for [issue].
I buy buildings as-is and handle all code compliance.
Would you consider a confidential offer?"

Owner relief:
- Don't have to fix violations
- Sell problem to you
- Below-market pricing acceptable

## 📈 VALUE-ADD OPPORTUNITIES (Maximize Equity)

### **How to Create Equity in Multi-Family:**

**Strategy 1: Raise Rents to Market**

Current: $900/unit (below market)
Market: $1,050/unit
Increase: $150/unit

24 units × $150 × 12 months = $43,200/year added NOI

Value increase at 6.5% cap:
$43,200 ÷ 0.065 = $664,615 added value

Your cost to implement: $0 (just raise rents at renewal)

**Strategy 2: Reduce Operating Expenses**

Current: 50% expense ratio (poor management)
Target: 42% expense ratio (better management)

On $300k EGI:
Current expenses: $150,000
Target expenses: $126,000
Savings: $24,000/year

Value increase at 6.5% cap:
$24,000 ÷ 0.065 = $369,231 added value

Your cost: $0 (just better management)

**Strategy 3: Add Washer/Dryer (Coin-Op or In-Unit)**

24 units × $25/month laundry income = $600/month = $7,200/year

Value increase at 6.5% cap:
$7,200 ÷ 0.065 = $110,769

Your cost: $15,000-$30,000 (depending on approach)
Net value: $80,000-$95,000

**Strategy 4: Add Parking Fees**

20 units without parking × $50/month = $1,000/month = $12,000/year

Value increase at 6.5% cap:
$12,000 ÷ 0.065 = $184,615

Your cost: $0 (just charge for existing parking)

**Strategy 5: Bill-Back Utilities**

Currently: Owner pays utilities ($18,000/year)
Change to: Tenants pay utilities

NOI increase: $18,000/year

Value increase at 6.5% cap:
$18,000 ÷ 0.065 = $276,923

Your cost: Install sub-meters ($1,500-$3,000/unit) = $40,000 max
Net value: $236,923

**Strategy 6: Cosmetic Renovations**

Light renovations (paint, flooring, fixtures):
Cost: $5,000/unit × 24 units = $120,000

Rent increase: $100/unit × 24 units = $2,400/month = $28,800/year

Value increase at 6.5% cap:
$28,800 ÷ 0.065 = $443,077

Net value: $443,077 - $120,000 = $323,077

**TOTAL VALUE-ADD POTENTIAL:**

Raise rents: +$664,615
Reduce expenses: +$369,231
Add laundry: +$110,769
Add parking fees: +$184,615
Bill-back utilities: +$276,923
Cosmetic renovations: +$323,077
───────────────────────────────
TOTAL VALUE CREATED: $1,929,230

Investment required: $160,000-$180,000

**This is how institutional buyers think.**
**This is how YOU present deals to buyers.**
**This is why they pay you $100k+ assignment fees.**
