## ⚠️ STILL INCOMPLETE (Honest Status)

### Requires User Action:
1. **n8n Workflow** - Manual setup needed (no MCP access)
2. **Google Sheets Headers** - Requires running with credentials
3. **End-to-End Test** - Requires #1 and #2 complete
4. **Situation Page Optimization** - Only homepage optimized, 12+ situation pages need wholesale messaging

### Why Not Done:
- **n8n:** No MCP server access, requires manual workflow creation
- **Google Sheets:** No service account credentials provided
- **Page Optimization:** Time/token constraints, would need 12+ more edits
