# HONEST TRUTH - WHAT IS NOT DONE

## ❌ NOT COMPLETED:

### 1. Google Form NOT Created
- **Status**: Script exists but NOT executed
- **Why**: Port 3000 conflict prevents OAuth server from starting
- **What's Missing**: The actual 33-question form does not exist yet
- **To Complete**:
  1. Kill email-server-oauth.js process
  2. Run OAuth script
  3. Authorize in browser
  4. Let script create form
  5. Get embed code
  6. Add to contact.html

### 2. Latest Commits May Not Be Pushed
- **Issue**: Git push keeps timing out with HTTP 408
- **Status**: Commits made locally but may not be on GitHub
- **Impact**: Live site may not have latest changes

### 3. Live Site NOT Verified
- **Truth**: I have NOT actually looked at the live deployed site
- **Why**: Been working on code, not testing deployment
- **Risk**: Changes may not be live, may have broken something

### 4. Google OAuth NOT Tested
- **Truth**: OAuth credentials exist in .env but never actually tested
- **Status**: Unknown if they work
- **Risk**: May need to regenerate credentials

### 5. Form Submission NOT Tested
- **Truth**: Contact forms have NOT been tested end-to-end
- **Risk**: May not actually send emails
- **Unknown**: If email-server-oauth.js actually works

## ✅ WHAT IS ACTUALLY DONE (IN CODE):

1. Header removed from all HTML files (code written, not pushed)
2. Top info bar added (code written, not pushed)
3. Lighter sections added (committed but maybe not pushed)
4. Apartments made primary (committed but maybe not pushed)
5. Testimonials added (committed but maybe not pushed)
6. All emojis replaced with SVG (committed but maybe not pushed)
7. Favicon fixed (committed but maybe not pushed)
8. All phone/cash/urgency removed (committed but maybe not pushed)

## 🎯 TO ACTUALLY FINISH:

### IMMEDIATE (Next 10 minutes):
1. Check git log to see what's actually committed
2. Force push if needed to get changes to GitHub
3. Wait for GitHub Pages to deploy
4. Actually look at live site in browser
5. Take screenshots of what's actually there

### NEXT (15-20 minutes):
1. Stop email-server-oauth.js
2. Run Google OAuth script
3. Complete browser authorization
4. Create the actual Google Form
5. Get embed code
6. Add to contact.html
7. Commit and push
8. Verify form works

### TESTING (30 minutes):
1. Test every page loads
2. Test form submission
3. Test email delivery
4. Test mobile responsiveness
5. Test all links work
6. Fix any bugs found

**Still TODO Before Compaction:**
- Google Form creation (script ready, needs execution)

## 🚨 TRUTH:
I've been coding changes but NOT verifying deployment. Need to:
1. Actually push everything
2. Actually wait for deployment
3. Actually test the live site
4. Actually create the Google Form
5. Actually verify it all works

THEN it will be complete. Not before.
