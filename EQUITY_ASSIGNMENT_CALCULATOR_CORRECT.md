# EQUITY ASSIGNMENT CALCULATOR - CORRECT MODEL

**Your Business:** Equity Assignment Specialist (NOT Flipper)
**Your Profit:** EQUITY captured in contracts, assigned to buyers
**Last Updated:** January 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ CORRECTED MODEL

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE: EQUITY IS YOUR PROFIT

**NOT ARV (After Repair Value) - That's for house flippers**
**YES EQUITY (Current Value - Contract Price) - That's for assignment specialists**

---

## 📊 THE CORRECT FORMULA

### **EQUITY ASSIGNMENT PROFIT FORMULA:**

```
STEP 1: Determine Current As-Is Market Value
(What property is worth TODAY, in current condition, no repairs)

STEP 2: Your Contract Price with Seller
(What you negotiate to buy it for)

STEP 3: Calculate Instant Equity
EQUITY = As-Is Value - Your Contract Price

STEP 4: Your Assignment Fee
YOUR PROFIT = 30-50% of Equity
(Or flat fee if you prefer)

STEP 5: Buyer's Purchase Price
Buyer Pays = Your Contract Price + Your Assignment Fee

STEP 6: Verify Buyer Gets Value
Buyer's Equity = As-Is Value - (Your Contract + Your Fee)
Buyer should get 20-30% equity minimum (their motivation to buy)
```

## 🏠 EXAMPLE 1: SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE (EQUITY PLAY)

**Property:** 3BR/2BA, 1,250 sqft, North End Winnipeg

**STEP 1: Current As-Is Market Value**

Recent sales of similar properties (as-is, not renovated):
- Comp 1: 456 Alfred Ave, 1,200 sqft, needs work, sold $185,000 (60 days ago)
- Comp 2: 789 Burrows Ave, 1,300 sqft, as-is, sold $195,000 (45 days ago)
- Comp 3: 321 Pritchard Ave, 1,250 sqft, fair condition, sold $190,000 (30 days ago)

Average: $190,000
Subject adjustments: +$5k (garage), -$3k (location)

**CURRENT AS-IS VALUE: $192,000**

---

**STEP 2: Your Contract Price**

Seller situation:
- Behind 3 months on mortgage
- Owes $145,000 total
- Desperate (score 78/100)
- Wants out fast

Your negotiation:
1st offer: $120,000 (62% of value)
2nd offer: $135,000 (70% of value)
3rd offer: $145,000 (75% of value) ← **ACCEPTED**

**YOUR CONTRACT PRICE: $145,000**

---

**STEP 3: Calculate Instant Equity**

```
As-Is Value: $192,000
Your Contract: -$145,000
────────────────────────
INSTANT EQUITY: $47,000
```

**This $47,000 is what you're playing with.**

---

**STEP 4: Your Assignment Fee**

Strategy: Capture 40% of equity

```
Total Equity: $47,000
Your Fee (40%): $18,800
Round to: $19,000

YOUR ASSIGNMENT FEE: $19,000
```

---

**STEP 5: Buyer's Purchase Price**

```
Your Contract Price: $145,000
+ Your Assignment Fee: +$19,000
────────────────────────────────
BUYER PAYS SELLER: $164,000
```

**Buyer brings $164,000 to closing.**
**You get $19,000 assignment fee at closing.**
**Seller gets $164,000 (pays off $145k mortgage, nets $14k after closing costs).**

---

**STEP 6: Verify Buyer Gets Value**

```
As-Is Value: $192,000
Buyer Pays: -$164,000
────────────────────────
BUYER'S EQUITY: $28,000 (14.6% equity)
```

**Plus ARV Potential (bonus for buyer):**
If buyer renovates:
- Repairs needed: $45,000
- ARV after repairs: $265,000
- Buyer's total investment: $164k + $45k = $209k
- Buyer's ARV equity: $265k - $209k = $56,000
- Buyer's profit if they flip: $56k - $15k (holding/selling costs) = $41,000

**Buyer gets 14.6% instant equity + $41k flip potential = GREAT DEAL**

---

## 🏢 EXAMPLE 2: MULTI-FAMILY (INCOME PROPERTY)

**Property:** 8-unit apartment building, St. Vital, Winnipeg

**STEP 1: Current As-Is Market Value (Income Method)**

Current Income:
- 8 units × $950/month = $7,600/month
- Annual Gross Income: $91,200

Operating Expenses (estimate 45% for older building):
- Expenses: $41,040
- NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI): $50,160

Winnipeg 8-unit Cap Rate (Class C, older): 7.5%

```
Property Value = NOI ÷ Cap Rate
Property Value = $50,160 ÷ 0.075
Property Value = $668,800
```

**CURRENT AS-IS VALUE: $670,000** (rounded)

---

**STEP 2: Your Contract Price**

Seller situation:
- Owned 25 years
- Tired landlord
- Deferred maintenance
- Wants to retire
- Owes $280,000 (low mortgage)

Your negotiation:
- Target: 75-80% of value
- 1st offer: $500,000 (75%)
- 2nd offer: $535,000 (80%) ← **ACCEPTED**

**YOUR CONTRACT PRICE: $535,000**

---

**STEP 3: Calculate Instant Equity**

```
As-Is Value: $670,000
Your Contract: -$535,000
────────────────────────
INSTANT EQUITY: $135,000
```

---

**STEP 4: Your Assignment Fee**

Strategy: Flat fee (easier for buyer to understand on commercial)

```
Your Assignment Fee: $45,000 (33% of equity)
```

---

**STEP 5: Buyer's Purchase Price**

```
Your Contract Price: $535,000
+ Your Assignment Fee: +$45,000
────────────────────────────────
BUYER PAYS: $580,000
```

---

**STEP 6: Verify Buyer Gets Value**

```
As-Is Value: $670,000
Buyer Pays: -$580,000
────────────────────────
BUYER'S EQUITY: $90,000 (13.4% instant equity)
```

**Plus Upside for Buyer:**
If buyer improves property (cosmetic updates, better management):
- Increase rents: $950 → $1,100/month
- New Gross Income: $105,600/year
- Better management reduces expenses to 40%
- New NOI: $63,360
- New Value at 7.5% cap: $844,800
- Buyer's investment: $580k + $30k improvements = $610k
- Buyer's new equity: $844k - $610k = $234,000

**Buyer's Play: $90k instant equity + $234k value-add = $324,000 total**

**YOUR PROFIT: $45,000 for finding and contracting the deal**

## 🏗️ EXAMPLE 3: DEVELOPMENT PLAY (LOT VALUE)

**Property:** Old bungalow on large lot, Fort Rouge, Winnipeg

**Physical:**
- Old house: 900 sqft, built 1955, poor condition
- Lot: 50' × 130' = 6,500 sqft
- Zoning: R3 (allows up to 6-plex)

**STEP 1A: Building As-Is Value**

House condition: Uninhabitable, needs $80k+ work
As-is house value: $40,000 (tear-down value)

**STEP 1B: Lot Value (CRITICAL)**

Recent Fort Rouge land sales:
- Comp 1: 50' × 120' lot, sold $220,000 (vacant)
- Comp 2: 50' × 130' lot, sold $245,000 (vacant)
- Comp 3: 45' × 125' lot, sold $210,000 (with teardown)

Average: $225,000 for similar lot

**LOT VALUE: $225,000**

**STEP 1C: Development Potential Value**

Zoning allows 6-plex:
- Build new 6-plex: $950,000 construction
- Sell 6 condos @ $280k each = $1,680,000
- Developer profit: $1,680k - $950k - $225k lot = $505,000

OR rent 6 units:
- 6 units × $1,400/month = $8,400/month
- Annual income: $100,800
- NOI (assume 35% expenses): $65,520
- Value at 5% cap: $1,310,400
- Developer profit: $1,310k - $950k - $225k = $135,000

**DEVELOPMENT VALUE TO BUYER: $135,000-$505,000**

**TOTAL OPPORTUNITY VALUE: $225,000 (lot) + $200,000 (development potential average)**

**CURRENT AS-IS VALUE: $425,000** (what informed developer would pay)

---

**STEP 2: Your Contract Price**

Seller situation:
- Elderly owner
- House falling apart
- Knows it's a teardown
- Thinking only about house value ($40k)
- Doesn't realize lot is worth $225k

Your negotiation:
- Seller wants: $60,000 ("house is worthless")
- You offer: $180,000 (generous vs their expectation, but 42% of true value)
- Seller accepts thinking they got great deal

**YOUR CONTRACT PRICE: $180,000**

---

**STEP 3: Calculate Instant Equity**

```
True Value (lot + development): $425,000
Your Contract: -$180,000
────────────────────────────────────────
INSTANT EQUITY: $245,000
```

---

**STEP 4: Your Assignment Fee**

Strategy: Capture 25% of equity (conservative, buyer gets great deal)

```
Total Equity: $245,000
Your Fee (25%): $61,250
Round to: $60,000

YOUR ASSIGNMENT FEE: $60,000
```

---

**STEP 5: Buyer's Purchase Price**

```
Your Contract Price: $180,000
+ Your Assignment Fee: +$60,000
────────────────────────────────
BUYER PAYS: $240,000
```

---

**STEP 6: Verify Buyer Gets Value**

```
True Value: $425,000
Buyer Pays: -$240,000
────────────────────────
BUYER'S EQUITY: $185,000 (43% instant equity!)
```

**Buyer's Play:**
- Buy for $240k
- Tear down house: $15k
- Build 6-plex: $950k
- Total investment: $1,205,000
- Sell 6 condos @ $280k = $1,680,000
- Buyer's profit: $475,000

**YOUR PROFIT: $60,000 for recognizing lot value + development potential**

**Seller happy: Got $180k for "worthless" house**
**Buyer happy: Gets $185k instant equity + $475k development profit**
**You happy: $60k for spotting opportunity**

## 🧮 EQUITY CALCULATOR FORMULAS (FOR SYSTEM)

### **Single-Family/Small Multi-Family (2-4 units):**

```javascript
// STEP 1: Calculate As-Is Market Value
function calculateAsIsValue(comps, property) {
  let avgPricePerSqft = comps.reduce((sum, comp) =>
    sum + (comp.price / comp.sqft), 0) / comps.length

  let baseValue = avgPricePerSqft * property.sqft

  // Adjustments
  let adjustments = 0
  if (property.hasGarage) adjustments += 8000
  if (property.hasBasement) adjustments += 15000
  if (property.condition === 'poor') adjustments -= baseValue * 0.10

  return Math.round(baseValue + adjustments)
}

// STEP 2: Your Contract Price (negotiated with seller)
let contractPrice = negotiatedPrice // User enters this

// STEP 3: Calculate Equity
let instantEquity = asIsValue - contractPrice

// STEP 4: Calculate Your Assignment Fee
let assignmentFeePercent = 0.35 // 35% default, adjustable
let yourAssignmentFee = Math.round(instantEquity * assignmentFeePercent)

// STEP 5: Buyer's Purchase Price
let buyerPurchasePrice = contractPrice + yourAssignmentFee

// STEP 6: Verify Buyer's Equity
let buyersEquity = asIsValue - buyerPurchasePrice
let buyersEquityPercent = (buyersEquity / asIsValue) * 100

// Minimum buyer equity check
if (buyersEquityPercent < 15) {
  alert("Warning: Buyer gets less than 15% equity. Reduce your fee.")
}
```

### **Large Multi-Family/Apartments (5+ units):**

```javascript
// STEP 1: Calculate As-Is Value (Income Method)
function calculateIncomePropertyValue(units, avgRent, expenses, capRate) {
  let grossIncome = units * avgRent * 12
  let noi = grossIncome * (1 - expenses)
  let propertyValue = noi / capRate

  return Math.round(propertyValue)
}

// Example:
let units = 12
let avgRent = 1000
let expenseRatio = 0.45 // 45%
let marketCapRate = 0.07 // 7%

let asIsValue = calculateIncomePropertyValue(units, avgRent, expenseRatio, marketCapRate)
// Result: 12 * 1000 * 12 * (1 - 0.45) / 0.07 = $1,131,429

// STEP 2-6: Same as above
let contractPrice = 850000 // negotiated
let equity = asIsValue - contractPrice // $281,429
let yourFee = 80000 // flat fee on commercial
let buyerPrice = contractPrice + yourFee // $930,000
let buyerEquity = asIsValue - buyerPrice // $201,429 (17.8%)
```

### **Development Plays (Lot Value + Potential):**

```javascript
// STEP 1A: Land Value
function calculateLotValue(lotSize, areaComps) {
  let avgPricePerSqft = areaComps.reduce((sum, comp) =>
    sum + (comp.price / comp.lotSize), 0) / areaComps.length

  return Math.round(lotSize * avgPricePerSqft)
}

// STEP 1B: Development Potential
function calculateDevelopmentValue(zoning, lotSize) {
  let potentialUnits = calculateMaxUnits(zoning, lotSize)
  let buildCost = potentialUnits * 150000 // $150k/unit avg Winnipeg
  let sellPrice = potentialUnits * 280000 // $280k/unit sale price
  let developerProfit = sellPrice - buildCost

  // Present value (developer wants 20% return)
  let presentValue = developerProfit * 0.30 // 30% of potential

  return Math.round(presentValue)
}

// STEP 1C: Total As-Is Value (Development Play)
let lotValue = calculateLotValue(6500, lotComps) // $225,000
let devValue = calculateDevelopmentValue('R3', 6500) // $200,000
let asIsValue = lotValue + devValue // $425,000

// STEP 2-6: Same process
```

## 🎯 YOUR ASSIGNMENT FEE STRATEGY

### **How Much to Charge:**

**Conservative (30-35% of equity):**
- First few deals
- Building reputation
- Competitive market
- Multiple buyers competing

**Standard (35-45% of equity):**
- Normal market
- Average deal difficulty
- Established relationships

**Aggressive (45-55% of equity):**
- Unique property
- Hard-to-find deal
- Limited buyer pool
- You added significant value

### **Or Flat Fee:**

**Small Deals ($150k-$300k value):**
- Flat fee: $15,000-$30,000

**Medium Deals ($300k-$700k value):**
- Flat fee: $30,000-$60,000

**Large Deals ($700k+ value):**
- Flat fee: $60,000-$150,000+

### **Adjust Based On:**
1. How much equity you captured
2. How hard you negotiated
3. How unique the deal is
4. How quickly you need to assign
5. How many buyers you have

## 📊 AIRTABLE FORMULAS (CORRECTED)

**AS-IS VALUE CALCULATION:**
```
// For single-family
IF(
  {Property Type} = "Single Family",
  ({Avg Comp Price/Sqft} * {Square Feet}) + {Adjustments},

  // For multi-family (income method)
  ({Units} * {Avg Rent} * 12 * (1 - {Expense Ratio})) / {Cap Rate}
)
```

**EQUITY CALCULATION:**
```
{As-Is Value} - {Your Contract Price}
```

**YOUR ASSIGNMENT FEE:**
```
IF(
  {Fee Type} = "Percentage",
  ROUND({Instant Equity} * {Fee Percentage}, -2),
  {Flat Fee Amount}
)
```

**BUYER'S PURCHASE PRICE:**
```
{Your Contract Price} + {Your Assignment Fee}
```

**BUYER'S EQUITY:**
```
{As-Is Value} - {Buyer Purchase Price}
```

**BUYER'S EQUITY PERCENT:**
```
({Buyer Equity} / {As-Is Value}) * 100
```

**DEAL QUALITY CHECK:**
```
IF(
  {Buyer Equity Percent} >= 20, "Excellent",
  IF({Buyer Equity Percent} >= 15, "Good",
  IF({Buyer Equity Percent} >= 10, "Fair",
  "Poor - Reduce Your Fee"
  ))
)
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DIFFERENCES FROM OLD SYSTEM

**OLD (WRONG):**
- Based on ARV (After Repair Value)
- Calculated as if you're flipping
- Your profit = back-end after repairs
- Required you to estimate repair costs accurately
- Risky (what if repairs cost more?)

**NEW (CORRECT):**
- Based on AS-IS VALUE (current market value)
- Calculated as equity capture specialist
- Your profit = instant equity assignment
- No repair estimates needed (buyer's problem)
- Zero risk (you assign before repairs start)

---
